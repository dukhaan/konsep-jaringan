How to Launch the Map

1. Copy the "ggpredict_traininghub.vpk" file.
2. Paste it into your maps folder. The default path is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\maps.
3. Open your Steam library and right-click on "Counter-Strike 2".
4. Select "Properties" and locate the "Launch Options" button.
5. Add the "-insecure" parameter to your launch options. Don't worry, using this command won't result in a VAC ban, but it will temporarily prevent you from accessing official servers.
6. Enjoy your training!
7. After you're done training, return to the "Launch Options" and remove the "-insecure" command before restarting the game for matchmaking.

Keep in mind that this is a temporary solution. Launching the map will become easier once it's available on the Steam Workshop. All data, including Leaderboard Scores, Total Kills, and Total Time Spent, will seamlessly transfer to the Workshop version once it's released.

Q: What to do if bots shoot at me?
A: For most users, resolving this issue is as simple as returning to the main menu and typing "sv_cheats 1" before loading the map. This should fix any problems.
